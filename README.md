# Unified By

Our goal is to create an ecosystem that is **unified by** a **single config file**. This config will be the interface to most, if not all, of your internet presence on both browser and terminal.

What it really means is to keep your Portfolio, Blog, LinkedIn, README(s), etc in sync with each other with each other via API Calls. Commit to the single config file will trigger a sequence of actions that will update all the linked accounts.
